#### Tool Versions

This command should check the version of the dependencies required for the sBTC
resources to be built and tested.

```bash
echo "\n--- sBTC tool versions ---" \
    && cargo --version \
    && echo "npm $(npm --version)" \
    && echo "cdk $(cdk --version)" \
    && echo "smithy $(smithy --version)" \
    && echo "openapi-generator $(openapi-generator-cli version)" \
    && java --version
```

Below is the output on a machine that is able to build and run all the sources and tests.

```
--- sBTC tool versions ---
cargo 1.77.2 (e52e36006 2024-03-26)
npm 10.5.0
cdk 2.139.1 (build b88f959)
smithy 1.47.0
openapi-generator 7.5.0
openjdk 21.0.2 2024-01-16
OpenJDK Runtime Environment Homebrew (build 21.0.2)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM Homebrew (build 21.0.2, mixed mode, sharing)
```

### Building

To build the sources you will need to run the following command before compiling the rest
of the sources. This is due to the rust code autogeneration that the emily package
requires.

```
cargo build --package emily
```

After running that command you can build the rest of the sources by running cargo
as usual.

```
cargo build && cargo test
```

### Operating Systems

This project currently supports development on UNIX-based operating systems but
does not support development on Windows or z/OS.

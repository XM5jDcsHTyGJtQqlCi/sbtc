//! # Canonical encoding and decoding for the sBTC signer
//!
//! The purpose of this module is to define how to encode and decode
//! signer messages as byte sequences.
//!
//! This is achieved by
//!
//! 1. Providing the `Encode` and `Decode` traits, defining the encode and decode
//!    methods we intend to use throughout the signer.
//! 2. Implementing these traits for any type implementing `serde::Serialize` and `serde::de::DeserializeOwned`
//!    using `bincode` as the encoding format.
//!
//! ## Examples
//!
//! ### Encoding a string slice and decoding it as a string
//!
//! ```
//! use signer::codec::{Encode, Decode};
//!
//! let message = "Encode me";
//!
//! // `.encode_to_vec()` provided by the `Encode` trait
//! let encoded = message.encode_to_vec().unwrap();
//!
//! // `.decode()` provided by the `Decode` trait
//! let decoded = String::decode(encoded.as_slice()).unwrap();
//!
//! assert_eq!(decoded, message);
//! ```

/// Provides a method for encoding an object into a writer using a canonical serialization format.

/// This trait is designed to be implemented by types that need to serialize their data into a byte stream
/// in a standardized format, primarily to ensure consistency across different components of the signer system.
///
/// The trait includes a generic method for writing to any output that implements `io::Write`, as well as
/// a convenience method for encoding directly to a byte vector.

    /// * `writer` - A mutable reference to an object implementing `io::Write` where the encoded bytes will be written.
    ///
    /// # Returns
    /// A `Result` which is `Ok` if the encoding succeeded, or an `Error` if it failed.

///
/// This trait is intended for types that need to reconstruct themselves from a byte stream, ensuring
/// that objects across the signer system are restored from bytes uniformly.

/// a convenience method for decoding from a byte slice.
